    abstract="Blockchain-based networks have found increasing usage in various fields due to their distributed nature, immutability, public verifiability, and zero trust requirement. Monolithic blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are not scalable. Sharding is a promising approach among the various solutions that have been proposed in the literature to improve the scalability of such monolithic systems. However, designing, testing, and identifying critical parameters of sharding-based protocols for blockchain networks is challenging. We present ShardEval, a simulator to evaluate sharding-based protocols for blockchain networks. We have used ShardEval to identify critical parameters of a sharded blockchain network. In particular, we determine the optimal number of shards in a network with a fixed percentage of cross-shard transactions. The simulation results are validated against the rigorous theoretical analysis, confirming the correctness under reasonable assumptions. Using the insights gained from simulation and theoretical analysis, we introduce Lookup Table to improve the transaction throughput further. The theoretical framework and simulator bridge the gap between designing and testing sharding-based protocols.",
